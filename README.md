# Github Game Off 2013 - Restaurant Escape

This is my submission for the Github Game Off 2013. I'm looking forward to read your comments on my game.

You can find the game itself at [my website](http://games.aleatic.com/game-off-2013/).

Even though we had a full month for creating the game I did it in one weekend. I hop you will enjoy playing it!

## Game Description

You had a nice meal in a good restaurant. Unfortunately, you are short of money and therefore try to leave without giving a tip. When the waiters see that they try to hunt your and get your loose change. Escape them and save your money!

Try to run as far as possible. Collect coins and power-ups on your way to increase your score.

Controls: click or space for jumping and once again for double jumping
